What is AI?
AI is a branch of computer science by which we can create intelligent machines which can behave like a human, think like humans, and be able to make decisions.

What is ML?
Machine learning (ML) is a type of AI that allows software applications to become more accurate at predicting outcomes without being explicitly programmed to do so.

What is DL?
Deep Learning is a type of machine learning based on artificial neural networks in which multiple layers of processing are used to extract higher level features from data.

Limitation of ML or why do we need DL over ML?
ML is not useful while working with high dimensionality of  data.
ML can not solve crucial AI problems like NLP, image recognition etc..
Feature extractions (ML can not automatically generate features)


Solution of ML limitations is Deep learning.
Deep learning models are capable of focusing on the right features by themselves, requiring little guidance from programmers.
These models also partially solve the dimensionality problem.
Deep learning is implemented through Neural Networks.
